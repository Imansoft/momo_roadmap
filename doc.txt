ðŸ“– Project Documentation â€“ Strategic Priorities Roadmap Website
1. Overview
This is a lightweight static website built with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks, no build tools).
It displays a list of strategic priorities, each with:
    A blue "Active" button â†’ navigates to a roadmap page.
    A grey "Inactive" button â†’ disabled/un-clickable.
Each roadmap is displayed using cards connected in sequence (like a flow of tasks). 
The roadmap "components" are simple HTML card structures that can be reused across different strategies.

2. File Structure
project-root/
â”‚â”€â”€ index.html        # Homepage: lists strategic priorities
â”‚â”€â”€ roadmap.html      # Roadmap template page (reusable)
â”‚â”€â”€ css/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ style.css     # All styling (buttons, cards, roadmap layout)
â”‚â”€â”€ js/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ script.js     # Handles button clicks, navigation, roadmap rendering
â”‚â”€â”€ assets/
    â””â”€â”€ (images, logos, etc.)

3. How It Works
(a) Homepage (index.html)
Displays a list of strategic priorities.
Each row has two buttons:
    Active (blue) â†’ clickable, links to roadmap.html and passes data (roadmap steps).
    Inactive (grey) â†’ disabled (unclickable).
    Example:
    <div class="priority">
        <h3>Customer Onboarding</h3>
        <button class="btn active" onclick="openRoadmap('onboarding')">Active</button>
        <button class="btn inactive" disabled>Inactive</button>
    </div>

(b) Roadmap Page (roadmap.html)
A roadmap container dynamically loads task cards from JavaScript.
Each roadmap is just an array of steps rendered as cards with arrows.
Example Layout:
    [SOLUTION ROADMAP]
    [Onboarding UXcam] --> [Integrate Dojah] --> [GTM Strategy with CCO]

(c) JavaScript (script.js)
openRoadmap(id):
    Stores which roadmap to load (via localStorage or URL params).
    Redirects user to roadmap.html.
renderRoadmap():
    Reads the roadmap ID.
    Loads the correct roadmap data from a predefined object.
    Creates HTML cards dynamically and injects into the page.

Example Data in script.js:
const roadmaps = {
  onboarding: [
    "Onboarding UXcam",
    "Integrate Dojah",
    "GTM Strategy with CCO"
  ],
  analytics: [
    "Onboard Mixpanel",
    "Integrate Gamification Engine"
  ]
};

function openRoadmap(id) {
  localStorage.setItem("currentRoadmap", id);
  window.location.href = "roadmap.html";
}

function renderRoadmap() {
  const id = localStorage.getItem("currentRoadmap");
  const container = document.getElementById("roadmapContainer");

  if (!id || !roadmaps[id]) {
    container.innerHTML = "<p>No roadmap available.</p>";
    return;
  }

  roadmaps[id].forEach((step, index) => {
    const card = document.createElement("div");
    card.className = "roadmap-card";
    card.innerText = step;
    container.appendChild(card);

    if (index < roadmaps[id].length - 1) {
      const arrow = document.createElement("span");
      arrow.className = "arrow";
      arrow.innerHTML = "&#8594;"; // â†’
      container.appendChild(arrow);
    }
  });
}

(d) CSS (style.css)
Button styles:
    Blue for active
    Grey (disabled, unclickable) for inactive
Roadmap layout:
    Cards with rounded corners, shadow, padding
    Arrows (â†’) between cards
    Responsive design (wraps on mobile)
Example:

.btn.active {
  background: #007bff;
  color: white;
  cursor: pointer;
}

.btn.inactive {
  background: #ccc;
  color: #666;
  cursor: not-allowed;
}

.roadmap-card {
  display: inline-block;
  padding: 12px 20px;
  background: white;
  border-radius: 10px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
  margin: 10px;
}

.arrow {
  margin: 0 10px;
  font-size: 24px;
}

4. Developer Notes
Reusable "components": Roadmap steps are just strings in script.js. Adding a new roadmap = add a new key-value pair.
Scalability: Can add more roadmap pages or fetch data from JSON/API later.
Routing: Purely client-side (via localStorage). No backend needed.
Extending:
    Add images/icons inside roadmap cards.
    Add categories or deadlines for each step.
    Export roadmaps as PDF/Excel.

5. Example Usage
User opens index.html â†’ sees priorities list.
Clicks Active â†’ navigates to roadmap page.
Roadmap cards appear in sequence with arrows.
Can return to homepage anytime.
